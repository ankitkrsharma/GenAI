    *   **Employee Well-being Programs:** Implement programs to address employee burnout, such as flexible work arrangements, wellness initiatives, and professional development opportunities.
    *   **Competitive Compensation:** Offer competitive salaries and benefits to attract and retain skilled IT professionals.
    *   **Training and Upskilling:** Invest in training and upskilling programs to enhance the skills of existing employees.
    *   **Strategic Outsourcing:** Explore strategic outsourcing options to supplement internal teams and address skill gaps.
    *   **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks to reduce workload and improve efficiency.

        üìâ Internal Risk Score:
        - Risk Score: 7/10
- Reasoning: Several factors contribute to a high risk score. The 14-day milestone delay indicates potential scheduling issues. Only 45% of customer payments received suggests financial strain and potential scope creep or customer dissatisfaction. The resignation of a key resource is a significant loss of expertise and continuity. While budget utilization is reasonable, the low team morale score (5.8) could lead to further attrition, reduced productivity, and quality issues. These factors combined paint a picture of a project facing significant challenges.
- Suggested Mitigation:
    *   **Immediate investigation into payment delays:** Understand the root cause (customer satisfaction, invoicing issues, etc.) and implement a recovery plan.
    *   **Project Schedule Review and Revision:** Analyze the critical path and develop a revised schedule incorporating resource constraints and potential delays. Communicate proactively with stakeholders.
    *   **Resource Replacement and Knowledge Transfer:** Immediately begin the process of finding a suitable replacement for the resigned key resource. Implement a structured knowledge transfer process to minimize disruption.
    *   **Team Morale Improvement Plan:** Conduct surveys or focus groups to identify specific morale issues and implement targeted interventions. These could include team-building activities, increased recognition, and improved communication.
    *   **Risk Management Workshop:** Conduct a facilitated workshop to identify and assess all project risks, develop mitigation plans, and assign owners.
    *   **Escalate to Stakeholders:** Communicate the project's current risk level and mitigation plan to relevant stakeholders (project sponsor, management, client).
